# Pizza Hunt Twitch Chat

## Quickstart

1. Open (in Notepad or a Text Editor) `twitchclient.js`.  Replace the second line (`channels: ['melat0nin']`) with your channel name instead of `melat0nin`.
2. If you want a custom image, save the image into the `sprites` folder with the name "player.png" or "target.png".

### To Run This

To run this go into the command line, `cd` into the folder, and run:

```shell
python -m http.server
```

Open a browser and go to <localhost:8000>.  You should be able to type "up", "down", etc., in your chat room to see the image move.
